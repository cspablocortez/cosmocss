                This demo page details a select set of elements that are meant
                to show off Simple.cssâ€™s styling, and provide HTML to help you
                get started easily. If you want a comprehensive demonstration of
                elements that may or may not be styled by Simple.css, please see
                our test page.

            <h2>Basic Typography</h2>
            <p>
                All the typography of Simple.css uses rem for sizing. This means
                that accessibility is maintained for those who change their
                browser font size. The body element has a size of 1.15rem which
                makes all the standard font sizes slightly larger. This equates
                to 18.4px for paragraph text, instead of the standard 16px. The
                heading elements also have an increased top margin in order to
                break blocks of text up better.
            </p>

            <h1>Heading Level 1</h1>
            <h2>Heading Level 2</h2>
            <h3>Heading Level 3</h3>
            <h4>Heading Level 4</h4>
            <h5>Heading Level 5</h5>
            <h6>Heading Level 6</h6>

            <p>
                This is a standard paragraph. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, which
                is Latin for "I forgot to write actual content." Designers have
                been using this placeholder text since the 1500s, proving that
                procrastination is timeless.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Bold text</strong> for when you're really serious and
                <em>italic text</em> for when you're being sarcastic. You can
                also use <a href="#">links</a> which have proper hover states
                and indicate if they open in
                <a href="#" target="_blank">a new window</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Code can be displayed inline with <code>code tags</code> or in
                blocks:
            </p>

            <h3>Pre without code</h3>
            <pre>
    Roses are red,
    Violets are blue,
    This text is preformatted,
    And this poem is too.</pre
